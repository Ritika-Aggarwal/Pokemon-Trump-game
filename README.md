# Pokemon-Trump-game
This is Python Project done for Introduction to API in python offered by Code First Girls

The project involved generating a random number between 1 and 151 to retrieve a Pokemon from the Pokemon API, creating a dictionary that contains the returned Pokemon's name, ID, height, and weight.
And repeating the same process for 2 players.

Note that the program is interactive - User is asked to choose the parameter from ID, height or weight to compare and decide which player won the game
